						Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain
						aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and
						character traits. These aims may include the development of
						understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various
						researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to
						distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require
						that education results in an improvement of the student while
						others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a
						slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the
						process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and
						dispositions possessed by educated people.

					<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
						Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
						purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes
						place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students
						learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the
						subject. It can be subdivided into various categories or levels.
						The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was
						created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education
						systems. Intelligence is an important factor in how the individual
						responds to education. Those who have higher scores of
						intelligence-metrics tend to perform better at school and go on to
						higher levels of education.

					<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
						The education sector or education system is a group of
						institutions (ministries of education, local educational
						authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities,
						etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children
						and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range
						of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals,
						teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can
						vary according to different contexts. The world is changing at an
						ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes
						obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore
						shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new
						knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible.
